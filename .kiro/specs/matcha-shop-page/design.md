# Design Document: Cozy Matcha Shop Website

## Overview

This design document outlines the architecture and components for a cozy matcha shop website to be hosted on GitHub Pages. The website will feature a warm, inviting aesthetic that showcases matcha products and provides a simple payment process via Venmo. The design focuses on creating a visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly experience that embodies the calm and cozy nature of a matcha shop.

## Architecture

The website will follow a simple static site architecture suitable for GitHub Pages:

- **Frontend-only Implementation**: Since GitHub Pages only supports static content, all functionality will be client-side.
- **Single Page Application**: The site will be designed as a single HTML page with multiple sections that can be navigated via the menu.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout will adapt to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
- **Local Storage**: For cart functionality, the browser's localStorage will be used to maintain state without a backend.

## Components and Interfaces

The navigation bar will provide access to all sections of the website:

- Fixed position at the top of the page

- Smooth scrolling to page sections

```

## User Interface Design

The UI will follow a cozy, warm aesthetic with the following design elements:

### Color Palette

- Primary: Matcha green (#8DC63F)
- Secondary: Warm cream (#F5F5DC)
- Accent: Soft brown (#A67B5B)
- Text: Dark brown (#4A3728)
- Background: Light cream (#FFF9E6)

### Typography

- Headings: "Playfair Display" (serif font for warmth and elegance)
- Body text: "Lato" or "Open Sans" (sans-serif for readability)
- Accent text: "Caveat" (handwritten style for a personal touch)

### Visual Elements

- Rounded corners on containers and buttons
- Subtle shadows for depth
- Natural textures (wood, paper)
- Plant/leaf motifs
- Hand-drawn illustrations where appropriate

### Layout

- Generous whitespace
- Grid-based product layout
- Section separators using decorative elements
- Full-width sections alternating with contained content

## Responsive Design Strategy

The website will be designed with a mobile-first approach:

### Breakpoints

- Mobile: Up to 767px
- Tablet: 768px to 1023px
- Desktop: 1024px and above

### Responsive Adjustments

- Navigation converts to hamburger menu on mobile
- Product grid reduces columns on smaller screens
- Font sizes scale according to viewport
- Touch-friendly targets on mobile (minimum 44px)
- Simplified layouts on smaller screens

## Error Handling

Since this is a static site without a backend, error handling will focus on client-side validation and user feedback:

- Form validation with clear error messages
- Graceful handling of image loading failures
- Fallback content for any dynamic elements
- Clear user feedback for actions (adding to cart, etc.)
- Confirmation messages for completed actions

## Testing Strategy

### Cross-browser Testing

- Test on major browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Ensure consistent appearance and functionality

### Responsive Testing

- Test on various device sizes and orientations
- Verify breakpoint transitions are smooth

### Functionality Testing

- Verify all navigation links work correctly
- Test product filtering and sorting
- Validate shopping cart calculations
- Ensure form validation works properly
- Test localStorage persistence

### Performance Testing

- Optimize image sizes for web
- Verify page load times are acceptable
- Test scrolling performance

## Implementation Considerations

### GitHub Pages Constraints

- No server-side processing
- All functionality must be client-side
- Limited to static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

### Asset Management

- Optimize images for web delivery
- Use appropriate image formats (WebP with fallbacks)
- Consider lazy loading for images

### Performance Optimization

- Minify CSS and JavaScript
- Optimize asset loading
- Implement responsive images
